# Road Rules
This document states the car driving rules of Harlon. You shall be aware and follow these if you drive a car/bike.

Harlon uses right-hand traffic, and the right lane of a double-lane road is per default the lane you shall drive in unless you are overtaking. 

## Road Signs
### Crosswalk
Slow down and check if there are any pedestrians willing to cross the road. It may also simply be crosswalk markings in the road surface. Pedestrians always have priority over cars, thus you must let them pass first.

### One way
The road you are now on/entering is a one-way road in the direction the arrow is pointing. You may thus not turn around and go back the other way.

### No Entry
You may not enter the road this sign is placed by.

### Slow Down
Usually an obstacle or sharp turn, etc. coming up.

### Warning for Bikes/Bike Path
Either marking a bike path (colored red) or is a general warning to look out for bikes.

### Motorway Start
Start of motorway.

### Motorway End
Motorway ends, slow down and prepare usually for a full stop at the end of the off-ramp. 

### Roadworks
You are either entering or approaching an area that contains roadworks. Adjust the speed accordingly.

### Diversion
Follow the orange signs for a diversionary route from the main road. These signs are usually found at motorway closures and/or country road closures where an alternate route is needed instead.
