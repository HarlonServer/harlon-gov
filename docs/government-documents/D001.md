- Each section is denoted with **§** followed by a number, for example 1, and §1.1, §1.2, §1.3 etc. are the individual rules in that section. A letter, ex. §1.2.A denotes a version of the rule, extra information or suggested punishments. 
- Sections may begin with short explanations.

## §5 Properties of HCS & Matters involving foreign servers
Anything built or made for the server in any way, both in-game Minecraft things, and other things such as for example the HCS logo, is given to the server for it to use. However, HCS must always credit the original creator of the design; HCS may not lie about who built what. However, it is important to note that it is very hard to keep track of who built each and every house in the city given that there are so many; for example a house by Antlucl may be confused for a house built by Optimized_ and vice versa.   
Thus, for example if you were to no longer have the Builder rank, you do not have the right to request all of your buildings to be removed.  
However, Staff can choose to honor the request if they wish and think it is a reasonable request. (Example: requesting to have your work on a building 4 people worked together on removed, is very unlikely to be accepted)  
- §5.1 Copying building designs, unique ideas of the server etc is in Harlon counted as plagiarism and is not allowed. Examples of plagiarism may be, but is not limited, to;
    - Introducing the very same idea as Harlon did shortly after its introduction on a foreign server
    - Copying any unique building designs of Harlon
        - §5.1.A Any major plagiarisation will lead to a permanent ban from HCS.
- §5.2 Using the Harlon Vehicles Texture Pack (The pack downloaded in-game, that contains the train and bus models as of 2021-08-30) officially on foreign servers, is strictly forbidden. 
For example, you are not allowed to use the train models for a metro system on another server, and then distribute the Texture Pack to others so they can use the metro on that foreign server.
You are not allowed to modify the models and then claim them as yours. As of 2021-08-30, all models contained in the Harlon Vehicles Texture Pack have been created by Antlucl and SirPenguinMay. It is important to note that the textures displayed on the models use whichever Texture Pack the player themselves has enabled; this is nothing Antlucl nor SirPenguinMay take credit for. 
    - §5.2.A Breaking section §5.2 will lead to an instant ban of all involved players in the usage of the Harlon Texture Pack on the foreign server. 
- §5.3 Attempting to, or successfully in some way hacking into the server and downloading things such as the world map is strictly not allowed and is counted as exploiting, hacking, stealing & plagiarism.
    - §5.3.A Any attempts will lead to an instant, permanent ban from HCS.
    - §5.3.B Talking, or threatening about doing so, may lead to a warning or ban from HCS.
- §5.4 Advertising is the act of telling other players on the server about another foreign server and is strictly forbidden. Advertising may count as, but is not limited, to;
    - Writing in chat the IP of a foreign server, and/or asking to join a foreign server.
    - MSG:ing or mailing a player in-game through those features telling about another server, the IP of a foreign server, and/or asking to join a foreign server.
    - Discord DM:ing a new player upon immediately joining the Harlon Discord server, randomly DMing a player of the HCS discord server of which you have no prior contact with, or spam-sending to many players in DMs of the HCS discord. This may also in some cases be against Discord ToS. 
    - Writing on signs any information about a foreign server, such as in Stenford Bay.
    - Telling another player a place to check for the IP (sending a server website, voting site, youtube channel etc). This applies to any way the advertising is being done.
    - Talking frequently about a foreign server in chat. Speaking of foreign servers in any HCS chat is not allowed unless in a clarification matter. 
    - Mentioning major servers, which have tens of thousands of players constantly online, and the general Minecraft playerbase know of, such as Hypixel, is permitted.
    - In any way or form, attempting to promote a foreign server on HCS is strictly not allowed. 
- §5.4.A Advertising may result in a kick from the Discord server (lasting 30 days) or stricter consequences such as a ban from HCS.

## §6 Exploiting, Hacking & Cheating
§6.1 Exploiting is prohibited. Whether it is minor or major, exploiting is exploiting. There are different types of exploits, from using hacked clients to hacking into the server. Using hacked clients is only allowed when they don’t give you any advantages. Please note, if you are exploiting even when there is no staff online, staff can check the console, and staff are the ones to decide what counts as exploiting.
§6.1.A If you use hacked clients in the way they are intended to be used, you may get a warning, mute, or tempban depending on the severity, and how many times you’ve exploited.
§6.1.B Hacking into the server is considered a major exploit. If you get caught hacking into the server, you will be subject to a permban.
§6.2 Cheating in any way isn’t acceptable in HCS. Cheating gives you an unfair advantage, and can be done in many different ways, many of which are already covered in another rule.
§6.2.A If the cheating is not covered by any other rule except this one, staff will decide the punishment based on severity.


## §7 Stenford Bay
